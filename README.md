Welcome to my **data warehouse and analytics project** repository

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

# **Project Requirements**

### **Objective 1: Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)**

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision making.

### **Specifications:**
- **Data Sources:** Import data from two source systems (`ERP` and `CRM`) provided as `csv` files.
- **Data Quality:** Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration:** Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries
- **Scope:** Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### **Objective: BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)**

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

- **Customer behaviour**
- **Product performance**
- **Sales trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision making.
